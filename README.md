the first repository in Github

this is the first repository I made in Github, which means I now really join in Github.
before I create my first repository, all my time I spent on Github was read the answer of **C++ Primer** contributed by Mooophy and pezy, etc. now I am going to finish reading that book. after I complete the reading and comprehend the knowledge on this book. I think that is the time to find some project on Github to training myself.
